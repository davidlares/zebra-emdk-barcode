# Zebra EMDK Barcode API integration demo

This Test App is for demo purposes, it's untested for production environments. This app can run also in non-Zebra devices due to the `android:required="false"` property inside the `<uses-library>` tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

Notes:

1. Be aware of your `gradle` version.
2. Review all the `build.gradle` configurations, just in case of errors appear.
